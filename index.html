      <p> <b >Software on Devices</b>
      		<br>
			All devices must have a legally licensed and currently supported operating system.
			Exceptions must be approved by the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Information
			Technology. 
			<br><br>
			Users can utilize any legally licensed software or app that helps accomplish business or
			academic goals. Software or apps cannot be installed or utilized unless the user explicitly
			trusts the source and knows a legal license exists. 
			<br><br>
			Software license documentation must be retained to get technical support, qualify for
			upgrade discounts, and verify the legal validity of the licenses. 
			<br><br>
			Employees must comply with software vendor license agreements and copyright holdersâ€™
			notices. Making unauthorized copies of licensed and copyrighted software, even for
			evaluation purposes, is strictly forbidden. 
			<br><br>
			Vendor updates and patches for operating systems, software and apps must be installed
			on end-user devices, unless an exemption is granted by the Assistant Vice Chancellor for
			Information Technology.
			<br><br>
			Some classifications of software are expressly forbidden for security reasons. In general,
			users cannot utilize software that intercepts data they are not intended to see, interrupts
			the flow of data, modifies data they do not have permission to modify, jeopardizes the
			integrity of information technology resources, or fabricates any information. Exemptions
			must be granted by the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Information Technology for the
			following: 
			<br>
				<ul>
  					<li>Spyware is software that is used to gather sensitive information or to test for
					weaknesses in systems. It includes, but is not limited to, packet sniffers, port
					scanners, password cracking tools, key loggers, and vulnerability testers. ITSapproved
					spyware detection/removal software must be installed on all universityowned
					devices, if such software is available for the device. </li>
  					<li>Malicious code, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and backdoors, is
					software that performs an unintended, and often unseen task when executed by an
					unsuspecting user. ITS-approved antivirus software must be installed on all
					university-owned devices, if such software is available for the device. Antivirus
					software must run when the device is turned on. It must be installed to
					automatically update at least weekly. </li>
  					<li>Peer-to-peer file sharing software is used to share files with users over the
					network/Internet. Examples include Kazaa, Gnutella, Aimster, and BitTorrent.
					These applications are commonly used to illegally distribute copyrighted material.</li>
   					<li>Security bypass software is used to circumvent security mechanisms, like
					GoToMyPC and dsniff.
					 </li>
    				<li>Remote control software is used to remotely control or administer a system from
					another system and includes terminal services, PC Anywhere, and Back Orifice.
					(PCAnywhere is allowed when utilized through a VPN.) </li>
     				<li>Network management software is used to gather information from and to control
					network equipment. Only Information Technology Services staff is allowed to use
					network management software. </li>
     				<li>Ping sweeps are used to find devices that are active and being used. Port scans
					search for open ports that can be used to breach a network. This includes, but is
					not limited to, generic sweep, strobe, stealth, FTP bounce, Fragmented packet,
					SIN, FIN, TCP and UDP scans</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
				Information Technology Services staff may periodically scan the network to look for
				signs of the above software and ensure the integrity of the network. If prohibited software
				is discovered, the user will be contacted and asked to comply with this policy. 
			<br><br>
				If an employee suspects a device has been compromised or infected by a virus or
				malware not removed by antivirus or anti-malware software or suspects unauthorized
				access or tampering with a device, he/she should immediately stop using the device and
				call the Technology Helpdesk or contact a designated support person. 
			<br>
 	  	</p>
         <p><b >Access Control to End-user Devices</b>
         		<br><br>
         		It is the responsibility of each employee to ensure that all technology devices are
				accessed only by authorized individuals. Each employee must ensure that all technology
				devices for which he/she is responsible comply with all security policies, guidelines, and
				procedures. 
   				<br><br>
         		All end-user devices must be password protected where technically feasible.
   				<br><br>
         		Employees must use strong passwords that conform to the Password Policy. Certain high
				risk data, including Social Security Numbers, cannot be stored electronically unless an
				exemption to the Social Security Number Elimination/Usage Policy is granted by
				Information Technology Services and campus-approved encryption software is utilized
				for storing the high risk data. See the links in the Related Information section for the
				referenced policies.
         		<br><br>
         </p>
         <p><b>Domain Membership</b>
         	<br><br>
         		All Windows devices must be a member of the Educational establishment Active Directory domain unless not
				technically feasible. Exceptions must be annually approved by the Assistant Vice
				Chancellor for IT.
			<br><br>
         </p>
         <p><b>Patching/Updating</b>
         <br><br>
         		All networked devices must have a device management program where technically
				feasible that handles patching and upgrading of software
			<br><br></p>
         <p><b>Backups</b>
                  	<br><br>
         		If data is stored on a local device rather than a networked file server, the user must utilize
				a backup solution for the local device approved by Information Technology Services.
			<br><br>
		</p>
         <p><b>Destruction </b>
         		<br><br>
    		     Employees are required to delete data from devices when the data is clearly no longer
				needed or is no longer useful. Before deleting data, employees must ensure that removal
				complies with record retention schedules and that the data is not part of a legal records
				hold process. Record retention schedules are provided by the Division of Business &
				Finance.
				<br><br>
				Media, including paper, CDs, DVDs, etc., containing confidential information must be
				shredded for disposal. 
				<br><br>
				High risk data must be properly removed from hardware devices prior to disposal of the
				device. 
				<br><br>
			</p>
         <p><b>Remote Access/Network Connectivity</b>
<br><br>
Remote users must comply with the Educational establishment Network Services Policy.
<br><br>
Establishing local area networks or connections to existing internal networks requires
consultation with Information Technology Services to ensure that unauthorized access is
not allowed.
<br><br>
Only Information Technology Services may assign an IP address to a device. 

          </p>
         <p><b>Multifunctional Devices </b>
         	<br><br>
				A multifunctional device (MFD) is an office machine that incorporates the functionality
				of multiple devices into one piece of equipment. It is typically a combination of printer,
				copier, fax, and scanner. An MFD must not be used to print, copy, fax, or scan high risk
				data unless the device is configured securely. See the Guidelines for Multifunctional
				Devices on the Network in the Related Information section for configuration
				requirements. 
				<br><br>
         </p>
         <p><b>Physical Security</b>
         	<br><br>
				Each employee is responsible for the physical security of all devices, including mobile
				devices, assigned to the employee. All devices assigned to an employee will be stored in
				Firefly Objects on Loan.
				<br><br>
				Mobile digital storage media cannot be used to store high risk data unless the information
				is encrypted. When not in use by authorized employees, mobile digital storage media
				must be locked in secure enclosures, such as a locked file cabinet or a locked furniture
				drawer.
				<br><br>
				Mission critical applications and any application utilizing high risk data must be hosted
				on servers in the Information Technology Services Data Center or an NU Data Center. 
				<br><br>
         </p>
         <p><b>Enforcement</b>
         	<br><br>
			This policy is enforced by the Information Technology Services Security Team in
			coordination with Human Resources (staff) and/or Academic Affairs (Faculty). Failure to
			comply with this policy may result in disciplinary actions. 
			<br><br>
         </p>
